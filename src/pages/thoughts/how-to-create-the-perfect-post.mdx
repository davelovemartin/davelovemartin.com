Some notes on creating social media posts.

- What is the outcome _you_ want?
- How do you want your audience to feel?
- What's the problem you're solving?
- What's the story? (insight and emotion)

Stories resonate far more than information.

- What’s the hook? (1st two sentences)
- What’s the shift in thinking/transformation?
- What’s the ask/question?

## Posting on LinkedIn

- don't use links in your post (first comment?)
- optimise for comments - end with a question
- use three hashtags
