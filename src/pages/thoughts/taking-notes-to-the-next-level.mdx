My brain loves the internet. Each time I unearth a nugget of information, my brain lights up.

I might bookmark the page, or favourite the post. But my hunger isn't satisfied and I rarely return to it once I've read it the first time. My brain is an info-junky. I carry on scrolling.

## connecting the dots

My intuitive brain loves creating connections, integrating knowledge and lightbulb moments. I want to harness this super-power and I think I've found how.

When I read something or hear something interesting, I'm going to stop and take notes.

By making a conscious decision to act on new information, we can prevent being sucked into an infinite scroll and turn insight into action.

## a wiser way of working

I recently read an email newsletter from @fronterablog which talked about how to move from consuming information to creating knowledge and ultimately wisdom.

It argued that you forget most information you read or hear because you have limited attention.

The information that you consume matters - you need a healthy diet.

They recommended learning connected topics and using spaced repetition to remember what you learn.

By understanding and reflecting on new information, we can build our knowledge, form mental models and apply this knowledge to future decisions.

## I'm creating a digital garden

What's a digital garden? Well, as opposed to a blog - which typically is a reverse chronological list of published articles, a garden is a bunch interconnected notes, and essays that the reader can peruse through links.

The notes can stay as crude notes, or they can be tended to, and nurtured into more rounded essays over time.

Sowing the seeds is just the beginning but because the objective is to publish notes, we avoid perfectionist tendencies. How many times have you avoided making mistakes at any cost, making it harder to reach get things done?

Done is better than perfect.

## returning to tend to the garden

Transforming ideas and notes to essays, explaining the core ideas and how they relate to each other in plain language is a great way to make sure that you truly understand a subject.

And the internet is wonderful open resource full of people just itching to tell you their opinion. So <a href="/perfect-post">transforming notes to social media posts</a> and essays opens up the opportunity for feedback.

If we regularly return to refine notes into a post, an essay or after good feedback, we get that spaced repetition that helps us remember and shape ideas.
