import { Prism } from "@astrojs/prism";
import SvgExample from "@experiments/SvgExample.astro";
import BouncingBallOne from "@experiments/BouncingBallOne.jsx";
import BouncingBallTwo from "@experiments/BouncingBallTwo.jsx";
import BouncingBallThree from "@experiments/BouncingBallThree.jsx";
import Graphic from "@components/Graphic.astro";

When I started to learn to code websites, there were a few different options for creating icons. You could use a sprite sheet, or use a special icon font...

...but I always liked the idea of SVGs.

After all they are scalable, so they can be created with a small footprint but can be blown up to fill any large screen without loss of definition. And as a subset of XML, they can be written inline in HTML and targetted with CSS.

You can also import SVGs as JSX, in React (although [you may not want to do that](https://kurtextrem.de/posts/svg-in-js)).

You can create SVGs in your favourite Vector Graphic editing software, and export the code created and plonk it into your code. You can use the excellent [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) tool, to optimise the code as your favourite Vector Graphic software may add some extra bloat.

However, I thought it would be great to get under the hood and explore how to create SVGs from scratch.

## The SVG element

In HTML, there is a SVG element which you can use to render a SVG document fragment. The viewBox attribute defines the coordinates of your viewport. The window into your SVG world.

The first two numbers in the viewBox denote the top left co-ordinates of the viewport and the last two numbers represent the bottom right co-ordinates.

<Prism lang="svg" code={`<svg viewBox="0 0 48 48" />`} />

  <SvgExample />
</Graphic>

## Using CSS only

This example uses CSS Keyframes to animate a ball:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallOne />
</Graphic>

here's the css I used:

<Prism
  lang="css"
  code={`@keyframes bounce {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(160px);
  }
}
.ball {
  animation-name: bounce;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-delay: 0s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  fill: var(--color-highlight);
}`}
/>

## Animating with a javascript library

Here, I'm using <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/">GSAP</a> to scale the circle's X and Y dimensions to simulate how balls deform when colliding with the floor:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallTwo client:visible />
</Graphic>

With a shadow and shading:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallThree client:visible />
</Graphic>
