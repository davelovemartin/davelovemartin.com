Co-design change experiments with others. They may have better ideas and will be more vested in their ideas.

A small group of vested individuals can carry something forward. Co-design change with partners, not stakeholders.

Don’t become a figurehead — let others take the limelight and represent the effort.

Listen and connect before charging ahead. And don't make this about you.
