import { Prism } from "@astrojs/prism";
import BouncingBallOne from "@experiments/BouncingBallOne.jsx";
import BouncingBallTwo from "@experiments/BouncingBallTwo.jsx";
import BouncingBallThree from "@experiments/BouncingBallThree.jsx";
import Graphic from "@components/Graphic.astro";

I like the idea of creating code walkthroughs of how to do stuff in code as I learn.

This is very much incomplete at the moment but I'd like to come back to this soon.

## Using CSS only

This example uses CSS Keyframes to animate a ball:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallOne />
</Graphic>

here's the css I used:

<Prism
  lang="css"
  code={`@keyframes bounce {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(160px);
  }
}
.ball {
  animation-name: bounce;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  animation-delay: 0s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;
  animation-fill-mode: forwards;
  fill: var(--color-highlight);
}`}
/>

## Animating with a javascript library

Here, I'm using <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap/">GSAP</a> to scale the circle's X and Y dimensions to simulate how balls deform when colliding with the floor:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallTwo client:visible />
</Graphic>

With a shadow and shading:

<Graphic>
  <BouncingBallThree client:visible />
</Graphic>
