    <p>
      I've forged a career at the intersection of design and web development âœ¨.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love connecting the dots, being curious and innovating by
      experimentation, iteration and rapid-prototyping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a Masters degree in Innovation and Applied Entrepreneurship and
      have solid experience of working with Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking.
    </p>
    <p>Flexing my Frontend Engineering skills, I pride myself on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>writing well-formed semantic HTML,</li>
      <li>styling with CSS, and</li>
      <li>progressively enhancing with JavaScript (including React.js).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I champion inclusive design and web accessibility.</p>
