When I came across the idea of <a href="/thoughts/interstitial-journalling.html">interstitial journalling</a> I was immediately drawn to it as I tend to forget what's happened during the week when it comes to take stock on a Friday afternoon.

I believe that using interstitial journalling will help me have more creative insight and will help me be more productive.

I know this will have worked if:

- I am not lost by distractions (like ideas popping into my head) or [procrastinating](/thoughts/procrastination.html). I notice triggers and develop new responses to those cues,
- I use a [decision log](/thoughts/making-your-mind-up.html) help me think through problems,
- weekly reviews are easier to write.
