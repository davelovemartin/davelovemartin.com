I read [this article from the Harvard Business Review about Effective Meetings](https://hbr.org/2015/11/two-things-to-do-after-every-meeting) and it’s amazing how many times this has helped me at work. I keep coming back to its simple advice:

- after each meeting, quickly send out clear and concise meeting notes, and
- follow up on the actions made.

That's it.

In implementing this, I've found I can get people to read the notes by asking them to check for accuracy.

I rarely take detailed notes about everything that has been spoken about, you might as well just record the meeting, but I like to capture decisions and actions.

Ensure that each action has an owner and ask them to report back when they complete the task (or provide a status update at an agreed future point) so you don't have to remember to chase.
