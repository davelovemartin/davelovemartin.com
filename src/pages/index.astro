      I've forged a career at the intersection of design and web development ✨
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm exploring Innovation and Design Thinking in tech with a human-centered
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      I advocate{" "}

      >
        Lean UX
      </a>
      , thriving in collaborative environments where my empathy, creativity and leadership
      sparks innovation and brings out the best qualities of my team.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a generalist and creative, I love connecting the dots, staying curious
      and experimenting with what’s possible
    </p>
    <p>Flexing my Frontend Engineering skills, I pride myself on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>writing well-formed semantic HTML (and SVG),</li>
      <li>styling with CSS, and</li>
      <li>progressively enhancing with JavaScript (including React.js).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I champion inclusive design and web accessibility.</p>
