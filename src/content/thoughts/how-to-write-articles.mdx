import ReadMore from "@components/ReadMore.astro";

## Step 1

Write your H2s first.

- The scaffolding to build the rest of your story around
- Should be skimmable so they make sense as an abridged version of your story
- Should contain keywords

## Step 2

Write 2–3 key takeaways under each H2.

## Step 3

String those 2–3 main points together with:

- Examples
- Stats
- Anecdotes

## Step 4

- Write your intro: a beginning… sketching the problem
- Make sure the middle describes how the problem was solved - the action
- There should be a final part… explaining how the hero lived happily ever after - the moral of the story
- Write your key points in a conclusion
- Whip up a few title options (which include your target keyword!)
