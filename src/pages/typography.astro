    <h1>This is a h1</h1>
    <p>
      If text is set ragged right, the word space (the space between words) can
      be fixed and unchanging. If the text is justified (set flush left and
      right), the word space must be elastic. In either case the size of the
      ideal word space varies from one circumstance to another, depending on
      factors such as letterfit, type color, and size.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loosely fitted or bold face will need a larger interval between the
      words. At larger sizes, when letterfit is tightened, the spacing of words
      can be tightened as well
