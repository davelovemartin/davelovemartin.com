Procrastination is a habitual tendency to delay a task you planned to do. How often do you come up with an excuse to avoid what you have to do and carry out an activity which makes you feel better instead?

Procrastination is a habit. And if you want to tackle procrastination, you need to understand how habits work:

1. The cue — a trigger that sets your brain off on an automated response.
2. The routine — a habitual response that your brain makes when triggered by the cue.
3. The reward — every habit develops because the brain gives us a feeling of pleasure. To change a bad habit, you need to develop alternative rewards.
4. Belief — our fundamental beliefs also power habits. To change habits you need to change your view of them.

By changing your reaction to cues that trigger the habit of procrastination, you can override a habit.

- recognise the cues
- develop new responses (changing your location can help)
- reward the new behaviour (be consistent)

One tool for thinking differently about tasks is to concentrate less on the product of the task (as this is causing the anxiety that your brain is trying to avoid) but instead concentrate on the process of carrying out the task. The process relates to the flow of time and the actions associated with that flow of time.

By thinking about the process of carrying out work, rather than the product of the task, your goal changes to something more manageable.

Here's a process to get started:

- elimate distractions,
- put some music on,
- set a pomodoro timer for 25 minutes,
- concentrate,
- when the timer is up, take a break.
