Inspiring culture change:

- How will people personally benefit?
- How can you give them something to look forward to?
- What does an improved experience look like?

- Can you build a coalition — a diverse network that shares a common purpose? Ensure your motion makers are on board, fully grasp the changes and can explain them well.
- How can you create spaces for members to craft strategy and discuss tactics?

- How can you spotlight *examples* of desired actions?
- How might you show, (don't tell), people what the future could look like?
- What projects could demonstrate desired behaviours?

- What symbols of solidarity can you create?
