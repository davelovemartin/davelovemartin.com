Have you ever wondered how some people just have a certain magnetism?

Maybe because we find it hard to quantify what makes someone charismatic, we believe it probably just comes naturally to some.

But charisma isn’t necessarily innate, you can learn to be charismatic.

Here’s how…

According to John Antonakis, professor of organisational behaviour at the University of Lausanne there are a number of Charisma Leadership Tactics you can practice to develop charisma.

You can use:

- metaphor, similies and analogies to help understanding,
- stories and anecdotes to connect on a human-level,
- contrasts to explain your reasoning by comparing against its opposite (build the right thing before you build the thing right),
- rhetorical questions — to engage,
- three-part lists — to distill take aways, give an impression of completeness and prove a pattern,
- expression of moral conviction — to reflect the groups vibe, establish creditability and show passion,
- ambitious goals and the confidence that they are achievable — to inspire and demonstrate passion,
- expressions of voice, gestures and face:
  - Voice — vary the volume; whisper at certain points rising to a crescendo, use pauses to convey control,
  - Gestures — Waving a hand, pointing or punding a desk can draw attention, a fist can reinforce confidence,
  - Face — make eye contact, get comfortable smiling, frowning and laughing at work.

By using these techniques you can tap into the hopes and ideals of your listeners, embue a sense of purpose, and inspire them to follow you.
