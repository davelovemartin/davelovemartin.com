I created a canvas to help teams chose what technology is right for their projects. I came across this process working with Andy Brace, a technical architect, on GDS projects and have adapted some of the ideas...

## Introduction

We create value by solving people's problems. If we create products to serve people's needs, then they will use them.

**A Technical Discovery is a process that can de-risk investment in technology.**

We explore the problem to make sure
**we build the right thing...
before we build the thing right**.

It's formed of ten basic building blocks in a pre-structured canvas
that helps teams draw out, discuss, and discover
with user needs and desired business outcomes at their core.

You start with...

When you start a project, reframe it as a problem to be solved.

### 2. Business outcomes and measurement

Measuring what's happening now can help you to understand how much the problem is currently costing.

Check out Dovetail for the rich insight from our user research and cusomer feedback, and ensure a UX consultant is part of the team. Without good knowledge of user needs, we are building on a bed of sand.

By having a good understanding of what types of users and customers we should focus on, we ensure that we are creating experiences our customers value. It's a solid foundation for production.

Create a candidate solution, a technical architecture, from your highest scoring technologies. This will form a hypothesis about the technologies you believe can work together to help solve the identified problem.
