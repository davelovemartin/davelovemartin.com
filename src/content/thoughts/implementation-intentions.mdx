Implementation intentions are a strategy to help overcome obstacles towards a goal.

They are a planning tool that mitigates the risk of things derailing your plans. You think of all the distractions or self-defeating behaviours that may crop up when planning some work or activity and then come up with tactics to prevent them happening or minimising their effect.

For example, if I find myself getting tired and distracted, I will get up and go for a walk around the block to re-energise myself.
