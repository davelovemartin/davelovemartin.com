## How dopamine rules your life

You may know dopamine as the *feel good* chemical in your brain. Along with serotonin, which regulates your mood, appetite and sleep, and oxytocin which is involved in regulating social behaviour and feelings of intimacy, dopamine is a neuromodulator closely associated with feelings of happiness.

Dopamine is released in response to pleasurable stimuli, such as food, sex, or drugs, and it sends a signal to the brain that says, "This is good, do it again." It's like a high-five from your brain, rewarding you for engaging in activities that lead to pleasure and reinforcing those behaviours.

You can think of dopamine as the conductor of an orchestra — its role is integral to many of your systems. Just as the conductor directs and coordinates the actions of the musicians, dopamine helps coordinate and regulate different areas of the brain.

Dopamine controls your primitive seeking and foraging behaviours. Seeking things that makes us feel good, food, water, salt, sex; and avoiding things that make us feel bad.

Your energy and mindset are controlled by dopamine. When you are in a low dopamine state, you are lethargic. When you are in a high dopamine state you are really excited.

Dopamine is critical for normal movement control, and its loss in Parkinson's disease leads to a range of motor symptoms, including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), and postural instability. These symptoms occur because the basal ganglia, the part of the brain that is responsible for movement control, is not receiving enough dopamine to function properly.

With dopamine completely inhibited, we essentially become paralysed. Without dopamine, we can’t get out of bed.

## How your reward system works and why layering is bad

Dopamine is released in the brain in two ways: tonic and phasic release.

Tonic release refers to the continuous, low-level release of dopamine that provides a baseline level of dopamine in your brain. This tonic release helps regulate various functions, such as maintaining attention and alertness, as well as mood.

Phasic release, on the other hand, refers to the brief, intense bursts of dopamine that are released in response to pleasurable stimuli, such as food, drugs, or sex. This release of dopamine is much larger and more rapid than tonic release, and it creates a strong signal of pleasure and reinforcement in your brain.

But there is only so much dopamine in your system, so after a phasic release and peak of dopamine levels, your dopamine is depleted and you experience a trough below your normal baseline. It takes a while for your baseline to build back up to normal levels.

Different behaviours cause different peaks and those peaks last for different lengths of time.

Eating some chocolate causes dopamine to spike one and a half times its normal levels. Mmm chocolate.

Taking cocaine spikes your dopamine levels by X.

Interestingly, we get a dopamine spike when we hear or read something that validates our beliefs.

So, immediately after you experience a dopamine high, your dopamine is in a depleted state. If you experience the same thing again, it won't have the same effect as there is less dopamine in your system to spike.

This is how we build up tolerances to things. [expand]

### Layering

Using your smart phone is a pleasurable experience. It contains a multitude of apps that have been finetuned to take advantage of your dopamine system to make them addictive. Many people enhance experiences by using their device, to take photos or live tweet or whatever.

However, it's this layering effect that is particularly bad. We are already getting an increase of dopamine from the activity we are doing, but adding additional dopamine spikes through smart phone usage is particularly bad.

[draw this]

How often have you been doing something enjoyable only to pull out your smart phone and get completely distracted from what you were doing?

I know I have. I used to use my iPhone when practising guitar. I have found myself looking up song lyrics on my phone and getting completely distracted.

## How to change and use dopamine to your advantage

### Cold turkey

So one thing we can do is to go cold turkey on some of these behaviours. There are plenty of products [research this] that will help you do a digital detox.

We lose that tolerance that we build up and we start to enjoy the mundane. [expand]

Try a complete fast from social media, videogames, and phone use for 30 days.

If nothing else, avoid layering.

### Intermittant random rewards

Instead of chronically spiking dopamine... randomly reward behaviours you do want to do. [expand]

### Don't spike dopamine at the begining or end of an activity.

[expand]

### Cold water exposure

Exposure to cold water gives you a slow build of dopamine that lasts for hours.

[expand]

### Establishing a growth mindset

You need to convince yourself that hard work is the goal. Working for a reward that pays off a long time in the future is hard. But, if you believe that striving to be better is enjoyable then you can spike your dopamine levels. You have to tell yourself that in that momement you are doing this by choice and you are doing it because you love it.

Another example of this is if you are doing Intermittent Fasting.  If you concentrate on breaking the fast as the reward, then fasting can be difficult. But by attaching dopamine to the fasting by thinking about all the good that is happening to your body [expand], then the reward becomes the fast.
