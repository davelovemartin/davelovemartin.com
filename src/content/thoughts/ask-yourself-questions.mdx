If you read through my notes, you'll notice I ask a lot of questions.

I do this to pose the questions to myself as the next time I read them might be the time where they could be useful.

I want to act on, reflect and iterate on the notes. Read my reflective essay, [taking notes to the next level](/thoughts/taking-notes-to-the-next-level).

Questions are more powerful than statements because the subconscious processes them differently.

For example, when planning a task, it's good to ask yourself: "what would this look like if this was easy?"
