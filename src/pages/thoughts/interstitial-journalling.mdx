I'd started doing a weekly journal at the end of the working week to help me reflect on events. It's helped me to this about how I might do things differently and learn from what's occurred - I'd say it's been helpful but it has a couple of issues.

First of all, Friday afternoons I'm not in the best frame of mind. I timebox the exercise to add some urgency but I can be quite tired from the week and sometimes, I'm trying to finish some work by the end of the day.

Secondly, I've started to just journal as and when I need to clarify my thinking.

I stumbled across an <a href="https://betterhumans.pub/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef">article on Interstitial Journalling by
Tony Stubblebine</a> and I can really see the benefits of this approach. Tony sells it as a "new journaling tactic that immediately kills procrastination and boosts creative insights".

- there's a really nice tie in with the pomodoro method and <a href="./metacognition#keep-a-learning-journal">learning journal</a>
- when we transition between projects or tasks, we continue to think about what we've just been working on. Some closure helps us concentrate on the next task
- Journal about what you just did - it should be a few sentences, and then journal about your next task.
- jot down anything else that comes to mind so as to reduce your cognitive load.
- as well as emptying our minds of the last project, this also gives us the mental space to think strategically about our next project
- you can write your next tasks as a mini to-do-list to help structure your thinking
- when thoughts or ideas do pop into your head, you can note them down in your journal, tag them so you can easily return later, and then carry on with the task in hand
- you could start your day with a check-in, asking yourself how you feel, what are your fears for the day and what you are looking forward to and bullet-pointing the answers
- Journaling as you work produces mindfulness about your context, goals, mood, and skills

<a href="./procrastination">Procrastination</a> is often a short term mood repair
initiated by your subconscious. Having a journal gives you a habitual response to
noticing your procrastination.

Take a note of the time, what you felt the trigger was, what you did and how long you were lost for.
