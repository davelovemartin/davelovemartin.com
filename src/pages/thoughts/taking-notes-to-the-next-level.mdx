My brain loves reading the internet. Each time I unearth a nugget of information, my brain gets a little hit.

_Ding_ Mmm tasty information morsel.

I might bookmark the page, or favourite the post. But my hunger isn't satisfied and I rarely return to it once I've read it the first time. My brain is an info-junky. I carry on scrolling.

## smashing ideas together

Sometimes, I'll be reading something, and my brain makes a connection with some other thing. This is when I get a bigger hit.

_Kaboom_ a taste explosion!

Like two atoms being smashed together in a particle accelerator, the constitutional sub-atomic ideas fizz and arc around and briefly fuse together in novel ways in my brain. It's a buzz alright but unless I write this eureka moment down, it fades out of existence and ultimately it's just another dopamine moment.

## connecting the dots

This intuitive brain of mine often makes mental leaps, creating connections, integrating knowledge and solving puzzles. I want to harness this super-power and I think I've found how.

## a new way of working

I recently read an email newsletter from @fronterablog which talked about how to move from consuming information to creating knowledge and ultimately wisdom.

It argued that you forget most information you read or hear because you have limited attention. So the information that you consume matters. They recommended learning connected topics and using spaced repetition to remember what you learn.

By remembering, understanding and reflecting on new information (building knowledge), we can form mental models and apply this knowledge to future decisions (wisdom).

## I'm creating a digital garden

What's a digital garden? Well, as opposed to a blog - which typically is a reverse chronological list of published articles, a garden is a bunch interconnected notes, and essays that the reader can peruse through links.

The notes can stay as crude notes, or they can be tended to, and nurtured into more rounded essays over time.

This method would mean that I can overcome my perfectionist tendencies to create "finished" articles - just publishing anything is "good enough". Sowing the seeds is just the beginning.

Done is better than perfect.

## returning to tend to the garden

To remember information, we understand from Feynman, that the key to learning a subject is to teach it to other people.

Transforming ideas and notes to essays, explaining the core ideas and how they relate to each other in plain language is a great way to make sure that you truly understand a subject.

There are a great number of people learning in the open. And the internet is wonderful open resource full of people just itching to tell you how wrong you are! Or at least give you feedback.

## growing a repository of inter-connected ideas,

By regularly building on ideas and soliciting feedback will help me retain knowledge and shape my ideas. By creating new mental-models that can add to decision making.
