      This digital garden is where I share reflections, sowing seeds of thought
      that can be cultivated and nutured into fruitful structured writing.

      </a>, this is not a chronological blog but an evergreen place where ideas
      can be edited and refined.

      It is better to work in the open and be comfortable with iterative
      progress, than wait for the big reveal...
