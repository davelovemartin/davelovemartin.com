  <Writing />
  <p>
    I've forged a career at the intersection of design and web development âœ¨.
  </p>
  <p>
    My empathy, curiosity and creativity means that I'm happiest connecting the
    dots, coming up with novel ideas and innovating through experimentation,
    iteration and rapid-prototyping.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a Masters degree in Innovation and Applied Entrepreneurship and have
    solid experience of working with Agile, Lean, and Design Thinking.
  </p>
  <p>Flexing my Frontend Engineering skills, I pride myself on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>writing well-formed semantic HTML,</li>
    <li>styling with CSS, and</li>
    <li>progressively enhancing with JavaScript (including React.js).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I champion inclusive design and web accessibility.</p>
