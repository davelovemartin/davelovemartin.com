Our brain loves the internet. Each time we unearth a nugget of information, our brains lights up.

We might bookmark the page, or favourite the post. But our hunger isn't satisfied and we rarely return to it. Our brains are info-junkies. We carry on scrolling.

My intuitive brain loves creating connections, integrating knowledge and sparking lightbulb moments. I want to harness this super-power and I think I've found how.

## Taking notes on new observations

When I read something thought provoking or hear something interesting, I'm going to stop and <a href="./making-the-most-of-observations">make the most of observations</a> by taking notes.

By making a conscious decision to act on new information, we can prevent being sucked into an infinite scroll and turn insight into action.

But why are these notes so useful?

## A wiser way of working

Most information you read or hear is forgotten. Why? Because we have limited attention and capacity to retain information.

But note taking becomes more powerful if we reflect on what we've learned.

Information is merely refined data. Knowledge, on the other hand, comes from awareness and understanding based on our own experiences.

By exploring how our new information helps us see the world in a different light, we can upgrade our notes to a more personal and useful artifact.

Once we have this knowledge, we can use it to affect future decisions and behaviour.

So, here's my plan to remember and act on new information.

## Create a digital garden

As opposed to a blog, which is typically a reverse-chronological list of published articles, a digital garden is a bunch of interconnected notes and essays that readers can peruse through links. It's how we naturally browse the internet.

Sowing the seeds of ideas in pure note form can be the end of it. Or we can nurture the notes into more rounded reflective essays over time.

Because the objective is to publish notes, we avoid perfectionist tendencies.

How many times have you avoided showing rough versions of your work, hiding mistakes, making it harder to finish what you've started?

Done is better than perfect.

## Returning to tend to the garden

Explaining core ideas and how they relate to each other in plain language so that others can understand them is a great way to make sure that one truly understands a subject.

By returning to read your notes regularly, and <a href="./the-perfect-post">transforming notes to social media posts</a> and reflective essays, it opens up the opportunity for feedback and improvement.

Using spaced repetition is a great way to remember what you learn.

Because we keep coming back to the notes and refining them, you not only retain this new information better but by understanding and reflecting on new information, you can build knowledge, form new mental models and apply this knowledge to future decisions.
