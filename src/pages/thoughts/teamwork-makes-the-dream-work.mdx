Research has shown that employees with close connections at work are more productive, creative, and collaborative.

It's natural that we want to build connections with our team members.

We're more likely to take risks that could lead to innovation.

Make it easier for employees to identify and bond over what they have in common with one another.

Introducing new team members by their personal interests immediately humanizes them.

Highlight shared goals — the experience of working together toward a common objective, supports the development of friendships.

Studies show that workers who view their colleagues as essential to their success build closer friendships, have fewer disagreements, and view their work as more meaningful.

Emphasize team-wide goals that can only be achieved through working together.

Workplace disagreements can yield more creative solutions, better decision-making, and higher performance.

Relationship-building statements are a vital tool for fostering collaboration, expressing appreciation, and ensuring that contributors feel valued.

When fear of damaging relationships occurs, people are unable to do their best work. "If you don't like my idea, you don't like me."

A well-timed relationship-building statement can dramatically alter the tenor of a conversation

Partnership:
“I want to work on this project with you.”
“I bet we can figure this thing out together.”
Empathy:
“I can tell you're enthusiastic about this.”
“I hear your concern.”
Acknowledgement:
“You clearly put a lot of work into this.”
“You invested in this, and it shows.”
Respect:
“I've always appreciated your creativity.”
“There's no doubt you know a lot about this.”
Legitimation:
“This would be hard for anyone.”
“Who wouldn't be worried about something like this?”
Support:
“I'd like to help you with this.”
“I want to see you succeed.”
