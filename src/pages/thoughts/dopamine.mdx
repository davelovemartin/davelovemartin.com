## How dopamine rules your life

Dopamine is a neuromodulator.

Dopamine effects multiple systems.

Dopamine controls your primitive seeking and foraging behaviours. Seeking things that makes us feel good, food, water, salt, sex; and avoiding things that make us feel bad.

It's an integral part of how all lifeforms [check and expand] operate.

Dopamine controls your energy and mindset. When you are in a low dopamine state, you are lethargic. When you are in a high dopamine state you are really excited.

Dopamine controls motivation, and movement.

People with Parkinson's disease have damaged dopamine systems [check and expand]. They can't move properly because...

With dopamine completely inhibited, we essentially become paralysed.

By the way, if you want a more scientific explanation of these things...  [link to website](https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction/)

## How your reward system works and why layering is bad

Tonic and phasic release... tonic is your baseline [expand]

Volume metric release and local synaptic release.[expand]

The key thing to understand is that when we are rewarded for a behaviour, our dopamine is spiked... x happens [expand] and we get a peak in our dopamine levels.

But there is only so much dopamine in our system, so after our initial peak of dopamine levels, your dopamine is depleted and we experience a trough below our normal baseline. It takes a while for our baseline to build back up to normal levels.

[draw this]

Different behaviours cause different peaks and those peaks last for different lengths of time.

Eating some chocolate causes dopamine to spike one and a half times its normal levels. Mmm chocolate.

Taking cocaine spikes your dopamine levels by X.

Interestingly, we get a dopamine spike when we hear or read something that validates our beliefs.

So, immediately after you experience a dopamine high, your dopamine is in a depleted state. If you experience the same thing again, it won't have the same effect as there is less dopamine in your system to spike.

This is how we build up tolerances to things. [expand]

### Layering

Using your smart phone is a pleasurable experience. It contains a multitude of apps that have been finetuned to take advantage of your dopamine system to make them addictive. Many people enhance experiences by using their device, to take photos or live tweet or whatever.

However, it's this layering effect that is particularly bad. We are already getting an increase of dopamine from the activity we are doing, but adding additional dopamine spikes through smart phone usage is particularly bad.

[draw this]

How often have you been doing something enjoyable only to pull out your smart phone and get completely distracted from what you were doing?

I know I have. I used to use my iPhone when practising guitar. I have found myself looking up song lyrics on my phone and getting completely distracted.

## How to change and use dopamine to your advantage

### Cold turkey

So one thing we can do is to go cold turkey on some of these behaviours. There are plenty of products [research this] that will help you do a digital detox.

We lose that tolerance that we build up and we start to enjoy the mundane. [expand]

Try a complete fast from social media, videogames, and phone use for 30 days.

If nothing else, avoid layering.

### Intermittant random rewards

Instead of chronically spiking dopamine... randomly reward behaviours you do want to do. [expand]

### Don't spike dopamine at the begining or end of an activity.

[expand]

### Cold water exposure

Exposure to cold water gives you a slow build of dopamine that lasts for hours.

[expand]

### Establishing a growth mindset

You need to convince yourself that hard work is the goal. Working for a reward that pays off a long time in the future is hard. But, if you believe that striving to be better is enjoyable then you can spike your dopamine levels. You have to tell yourself that in that momement you are doing this by choice and you are doing it because you love it.

Another example of this is if you are doing Intermittent Fasting.  If you concentrate on breaking the fast as the reward, then fasting can be difficult. But by attaching dopamine to the fasting by thinking about all the good that is happening to your body [expand], then the reward becomes the fast.
